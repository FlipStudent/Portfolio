#Coding prompt: 
I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a function to check if a substring is present in a given list of string values.

Example input: ["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"ack"
Example output: True


Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

#Coding output: 

def is_substring_present(lst, sub):
    return any(sub in i for i in lst)


#Tester prompt: 

You are a tester in a code-review team. You will receive:
- A natural language description of what the function is supposed to do
- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

This is the user requirement: 
Write a function to check if a substring is present in a given list of string values.

Write a test report using the following structure:
{
  "Code compilation": Evaluate the structure, syntax, and logic correctness of the code. Will the code compile correctly?
  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.

#Coding prompt: 
I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a python function to check whether the last element of given array is even or odd after performing an operation p times.

Example input: [5,7,10],3,1
Example output: "ODD"


The report from the tester is as following:

{
  "Code compilation": "Yes",
  "Input/output": "Yes",
  "Improvements": "The function should return 'EVEN' if the last element is even after performing the operation p times and 'ODD' if the last element is odd. The current function does not perform this operation correctly. It only checks if the last element is even or odd after performing the operation once.",
  "Localization": "The function should be modified to perform the operation p times on the last element of the array. The current function only performs the operation once.",
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Failed"
}

This is the previous code which you need to improve:

def check_last_element(arr, p, q):
    last_element = arr[-1]
    for _ in range(p):
        last_element += q
    return "EVEN" if last_element % 2 == 0 else "ODD"

Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

    return "EVEN" if last_element % 2 == 0 else "ODD"


#Tester prompt: 

You are a tester in a code-review team. You will receive:
- A natural language description of what the function is supposed to do
- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

Write a test report using the following structure:
{
  "Code compilation": Evaluate the structure, syntax, and logic correctness of the code. Will the code compile correctly?
  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.

You are a tester in a code-review team. You will receive:
- A natural language description of what the function is supposed to do
- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

This is the user requirement: 
Write a python function to count set bits of a given number.

Example input: 2
Example output: 1

The code provided by developer is as follows:

def count_set_bits(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count


Write a test report using the following structure:
{
  "Code compilation": Evaluate the structure, syntax, and logic correctness of the code. Will the code compile correctly?
  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.
}

#Tester prompt: 

You are a tester in a code-review team. You will receive:
- A natural language description of what the function is supposed to do
- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

This is the user requirement: 
Write a python function to find the maximum of two numbers.

Example input: 5,10

  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.

I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.

Example input: "PYTHon"
Example output: ('PYTH')


Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

#Coding output: 

def remove_lowercase_substrings(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isupper())


#Tester prompt: 

You are a tester in a code-review team. You will receive:
- A natural language description of what the function is supposed to do
- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

This is the user requirement: 
Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.

Example input: "PYTHon"
Example output: ('PYTH')

The code provided by developer is as follows:

def remove_lowercase_substrings(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isupper())


Write a test report using the following structure:
{
  "Code compilation": Evaluate the structure, syntax, and logic correctness of the code. Will the code compile correctly?
  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.
}
