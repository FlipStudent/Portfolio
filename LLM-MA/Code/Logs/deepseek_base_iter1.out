- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

This is the user requirement: 
Write a function to convert a tuple of string values to a tuple of integer values.

Example input: (('333', '33'), ('1416', '55'))
Example output: ((333, 33), (1416, 55))

The code provided by developer is as follows:
def convert_tuple_to_int(tup):
    return tuple(tuple(int(i) for i in inner) for inner in tup)


Write a test report using the following structure:
{
  "Code compilation": Evaluate the structure, syntax, and logic correctness of the code. Will the code compile correctly?
  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.
}

{

  "Localization": "The function is defined correctly and the conversion is performed correctly within the function. The conversion is done correctly for each element in the input tuple.",

This is the user requirement: Write a function to find x and y that satisfies ax + by = n.

Example input: 2, 3, 7
Example output: ('x = ', 2, ', y = ', 1)


The report from the tester is as following:

{
  "Code compilation": "Yes",

  "Improvements": "The code is logically correct, but it can be optimized. The current implementation uses a nested loop to find the solution, which is not efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution would use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b, and then calculate x and y based on the gcd and the formula ax + by = gcd(a, b).",
  "Localization": "The improvements should be made in the function logic, specifically in the calculation of x and y. The current implementation can be seen in the lines 3-7 of the code.",

This is the user requirement: Write a function to find the number of flips required to make the given binary string a sequence of alternate characters.

Example input: "0001010111"
Example output: 2


The report from the tester is as following:

{
  "Code compilation": "Yes",
  "Input/output": "The function takes a string as input and returns an integer as output. The input string should be a binary string, i.e., a string composed of only '0's and '1's.

  "Improvements": "The function currently only counts the number of '0's and '1's in the string and returns the smaller count. It should instead count the number of flips required to make the string alternate between '0' and '1'.

}

Explanation: The function is not correctly implementing the requirement of counting the number of flips required to make the string alternate between '0' and '1'. It is currently only counting the number of '0's and '1's in the string and returning the smaller count. It should instead count the number of flips required to make the string alternate between '0' and '1'. This can be done by comparing each character in the string to its next character and incrementing a counter if they are the same. The function should also handle the case where the first character is '1' or '0' differently.

This is the previous code which you need to improve:

def min_flips(s: str) -> int:
    # Count the number of flips required to make the string alternate between '0' and '1'
    return min(s.count(str(i)) for i in range(2))

Write a function to check if a binary tree is balanced or not.

#Coding prompt: 
I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a function to find the maximum sum we can make by dividing number in three parts recursively and summing them up together for the given number.

Example input: 12
Example output: 13


The report from the tester is as following:

{
  "Code compilation": "Yes",
  "Input/output": "The function takes one input, an integer n. The output is the maximum sum we can make by dividing number in three parts recursively and summing them up together for the given number. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, so it should be ensured that the input is always an integer.",
  "Improvements": "The function seems to be correctly implemented. However, the last line of the function seems to have a missing closing parenthesis. This could cause a syntax error. Also, the function does not seem to return any value. It should return the maximum sum calculated.",
  "Localization": "The function seems to be correctly implemented. However, the last line of the function seems to have a missing closing parenthesis. This could cause a syntax error. Also, the function does not seem to return any value. It should return the maximum sum calculated.",
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Failed"

This is the previous code which you need to improve:

    if n < 10:
        return n*(n+1)//2
    else:
        s = str(n)
        d = len(s)
        a = [int(s[i]) for i in range(d)]
        f = [0]*10
        f[0] = a[0]

            f[i] = f[i-1]*10 + a[i]*i
        f[d-1] = max(f[d-1], a[0]*(d-1) + a[1]*(d-1)*(d-2)//2)
        for i in range(1, d-1):
            f[d-1] = max(f[d-1], a[0]*i + a[1]*i*(i-1)//2 + f[i-1] + a[i+1]*(d-i-1) + a[i]
Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

#Coding prompt: 
I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a function to find the maximum product subarray of the given array.

Example input: [1, -2, -3, 0, 7, -8, -2]
Example output: 112


The report from the tester is as following:

{
  "Code compilation": "Yes",
  "Input/output": "The function takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer as output. The function should return the maximum product subarray of the given array.",
  "Improvements": "The code is logically correct and the structure is also correct. However, the function does not handle the case where all the elements in the array are negative. In this case, the function will return the maximum negative number instead of the correct result. We need to add a condition to handle this case.",
  "Localization": "The issue is in the part of the code where we are handling the case of negative numbers. We need to add a condition to handle this case.",
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Failed"
}

This is the previous code which you need to improve:
def max_product_subarray(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    max_prod = min_prod = result = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] < 0:
            max_prod, min_prod = min_prod, max_prod

        max_prod = max(nums[i], max_prod * nums[i])
        min_prod = min(nums[i], min_prod * nums[i])

        result = max(result, max_prod)

    return result

Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

#Tester prompt:

  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.
