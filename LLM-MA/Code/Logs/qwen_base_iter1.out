I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

Example input: "hello","l"

I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a function to get the frequency of the elements in a list.

Example input: [10,10,10,10,20,20,20,20,40,40,50,50,30]
Example output: ({10: 4, 20: 4, 40: 2, 50: 2, 30: 1})


The report from the tester is as following:

```json
{
  "Test Report": {
    "Code compilation":
      {
        "Result": "Passed",
        "Explanation": "The code uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which is a built-in Python library. The code structure is clear, and the syntax is correct. The function `get_element_frequencies` takes a list as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each element."

        "Output": "{10: '10': 1, 1: 1, '1': 1}"
      },
      "Explanation": The function correctly counts the frequency of elements in the list. However, the input list contains a string '10' which is not an integer. This will raise a `TypeError` when the `Counter()` function is called. The function should handle this case by converting the input list to a list of integers before counting the frequencies."

          "Explanation": To handle the case where the input list may contain non-integer values, the function should first convert the input list into a list of floats or integers. This can be done using a list comprehension or the `map()` function. For example, `input_list = list(map(int, input_list))`.

#Coding prompt: 
I want you to act as a developer on our development team. Your job is to write or improve Python code that meets the requirements. Ensure that the code you write is efficient, readable, and follows best practices.

This is the user requirement: Write a function to find the ascii value of total characters in a string.

Example input: "python"
Example output: 112


The report from the tester is as following:
{
  "Test Report": {
    "Code compilation":
      "The code provided compiles correctly without any syntax errors. The function `ascii_value_total_characters` is defined and contains a logical structure that should work for the given requirements.",
    "Input/output":
      "For the input string 'python', the function correctly calculates the total ASCII value of all characters. The expected output is 113, but the actual output is 221. This discrepancy suggests that the logic in the function is incorrect.",
    "Improvements":
      "To fix the issue, the function should iterate over each character in the input string, calculate its ASCII value using `ord(char)`, and add it to a running total. The current implementation is adding the ASCII value of 'a' to the total for each character, which is not the intended behavior.",
    "Localization":
      "This fix should be applied in the `for` loop where the ASCII value is calculated and added to the total.",
    "Conclusion":
      "Code Test **Failed**. The function does not correctly calculate the total ASCII values of the characters in the input strings. The logic needs to be revised to properly sum the ASCII values of each character."
  }
}
This is the previous code which you need to improve:
def ascii_value_total_characters(input_str):
    total_value = 97  # ASCII value of lowercase 'a'
    for char_index, char in enumerate(input_str):
        if char == 'n':
            total_value += 98  # ASCII of 'n' (110 - 2)
        else:
            total_value = ord(char)
        total_value += ord('a')  # Add ASCII value of a to account for the offset
    return total_value

Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

#Coding output:

      "The code provided compiles correctly without any syntax errors. The function `extract_element-wise_and_tuples` is defined with the correct parameters and uses the `zip` function to iterate over the input tuples, performing element-wise subtraction. The function returns a tuple of the results.",

      "For the given input `(10,4,6,9)` and `(5,2,3,3)`, the function correctly calculates the element-wise differences: `(10-5, 4-2, 6-3, 9-3) = (5,2)`. However, the function is named `extract_elementwise_and_tuples`, which is not consistent with the example output provided. The output should be `(0, 1, 3)`, not `(0,0,2,1)`. The function should be renamed to `extract_element_wise_and_tuples` to match the example output.",

      - Rename the function from `extract_elementewise_and_tuples` (line 1) to `extract_elemtents_wise_and_tuple` (line1).

Remember, only provide code: do NOT explain the code and do NOT give test cases.

#Coding output: 
def cube_sum(cubed):
    return cubed**3


#Tester prompt: 

You are a tester in a code-review team. You will receive:
- A natural language description of what the function is supposed to do
- One or more input/output test cases
- The code written by a developer

This is the user requirement: 
Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n natural numbers.

Example input: 5
Example output: 225

The code provided by developer is as follows:
def cube_sum(cubed):
    return cubed**3


Write a test report using the following structure:
{
  "Code compilation": Evaluate the structure, syntax, and logic correctness of the code. Will the code compile correctly?
  "Input/output": Does the function take the correct number of variables? Are they in the correct format? How about the output?
  "Improvements": If there are problems with the code, what should the coder improve? Be specific.
  "Localization": Where in the code does this fix apply?
  "Conclusion": "Code Test Passed" or "Code Test Failed". If you are even slightly unsure, choose "Code Test Failed" and explain.
